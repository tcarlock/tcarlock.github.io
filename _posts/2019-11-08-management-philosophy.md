title: My Philosophy for Engineering Management
excerpt: >-
  Considering the leverage managers have over the careers of the people on their team and the results of the team's work, managers must 
  develop a coherent set of guiding principles for their decisions. These are mine.

I'm always surprised when a managers can't answer a fairly straightforward question: what's your personal philosophy of management? In other words, they can't describe the fundamental beliefs and priorities that shape their daily actions and decisions related to strategy, hiring, project staffing and team/organization design?

This has occurred about as often with experienced managers as compared to first-time managers who haven't had the length and breadth of experience needed to formulate a coherent and resilient philosophy. This is really unfortunate given the leverage that managers wield over the people on their team(s) and the impact–good or bad–that teams have on the organization.

So with that being said, here is the philosophy I've cobbled together over the years. Much of this borrows from and is inspired by thinkers and writers far more experienced and eloquent than me. Wherever possible, I'll cite prior work.

### Core Objectives
These are pretty self-explanatory, but in general there are three things that I'm always trying to optimize for:

* Velocity of execution
* Consistency and quality of results
* Efficiency of resource utilization

### The Four Tenets
For all actions and decisions, I think of everything in these four tenets:
1. Strategy - Based on some desired or assumed future state, this is the collection of bets and the plan I believe will get the team there.
2. Technology - Often a subset of strategy, this is the technical choices and tradeoffs that are made to accomplish some goal state.
3. Operations - This is the collection of operational choices that are adopted to help organize people and work, and ensure that a team works at optimum optput.
4. People - These are all of the various hiring, staffing and organizational-design decision.

### Strategy
This is an area where I see a lot of "front-line" managers falter. At this level, strategy is often viewed as either the domain of the Product organization or something that's set from senior levels of engineering management. Of course, there is a lot of strategy that's inherited from above (particiularly when it comes to core infra), and a PM usually should own strategy for achieving a particular customer experience or business outcome; however, there's a tremendous amount of technical strategy that required to get there, and more important, to ensure that other concurrent and future projects are also completed in a fast and efficient manner without incurring unnecessary cost and technical debt.

As I usually have worked on product-engineering teams, I'm heavily involved in setting the overarching strategy in partnership with the PM, but I'll also articulate and share a separate strategy specific to engineering. This

Eng vs People

### Wired Like an Engineer

### Management as a System Design Problem

### People Development
1. Purpose
2. Mastery
3. Autonomy
