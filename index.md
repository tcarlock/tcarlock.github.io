      <p>
        I grew up in the midwest where I studied and worked in investment finance 
        before starting a B2B software company. I then moved to San Francisco where I spent 8 years and transitioned 
        into consumer tech as an early(ish) employee of Uber. In late 2018, I decided to fulfill my desire to 
        live in NYC.

        Outside of work, I love traveling to experience new foods and I'm trying to spend more time reading. I enjoy running, 
        but my activity of choise is Muay Thai, which I've trained for 7 years in both the US and Thailand. Yes, I do occasinally 
        compete.
