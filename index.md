      <p>
        I grew up in the midwest where I studied and worked in investment finance 
        before starting a B2B software company. I then moved to San Francisco where I lived for years and transitioned 
        into consumer tech as an early(ish) employee of Uber. In late 2018, I decided to quit putting off a move to NYC.

        Outside of work, I love traveling and experiencing new foods, and I'm forcing myself to spend more time reading. I enjoy running, 
        but my activity of choice is Muay Thai, which I've trained for 7 years in the US and Thailand. Yes, I do occasionally 
        compete.
