I grew up in St Louis where I studied and worked in investment finance before starting a B2B software company. In 2011 I moved to San Francisco where I transitioned into consumer tech as an early(ish) employee of Uber. In late 2018, I decided I should stop putting off a move to NYC.

Apart from work, I love traveling and experiencing new cultures and foods. I've recently been spending more time reading, with a particular focus on non-fiction. I enjoy running and biking, but my activity of choice is Muay Thai, which I've trained for 7 years in both the US and Thailand. I do occasionally compete 🥊
